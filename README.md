# Walmart Data Analysis: End-to-End SQL + Python Project

Explore the Data -

Goal: Conduct an initial data exploration to understand data distribution, check column names, types, and identify potential issues.
Analysis: Use functions like .info(), .describe(), and .head() to get a quick overview of the data structure and statistics.

 Data Cleaning -
 
Remove Duplicates: Identify and remove duplicate entries to avoid skewed results.
Handle Missing Values: Drop rows or columns with missing values if they are insignificant; fill values where essential.
Fix Data Types: Ensure all columns have consistent data types (e.g., dates as datetime, prices as float).
Currency Formatting: Use .replace() to handle and format currency values for analysis.
Validation: Check for any remaining inconsistencies and verify the cleaned data.

Feature Engineering -

Create New Columns: Calculate the Total Amount for each transaction by multiplying unit_price by quantity and adding this as a new column.
Enhance Dataset: Adding this calculated field will streamline further SQL analysis and aggregation tasks.

Load Data into MySQL and PostgreSQL -

Set Up Connections: Connect to MySQL and PostgreSQL using sqlalchemy and load the cleaned data into each database.
Table Creation: Set up tables in both MySQL and PostgreSQL using Python SQLAlchemy to automate table creation and data insertion.
Verification: Run initial SQL queries to confirm that the data has been loaded accurately.

SQL Analysis: Complex Queries and Business Problem Solving -

Business Problem-Solving: Write and execute complex SQL queries to answer critical business questions, such as:
Revenue trends across branches and categories.
Identifying best-selling product categories.
Sales performance by time, city, and payment method.
Analyzing peak sales periods and customer buying patterns.
Profit margin analysis by branch and category.
Documentation: Keep clear notes of each query's objective, approach, and results.

Project Publishing and Documentation -

Documentation: Maintain well-structured documentation of the entire process in Markdown or a Jupyter Notebook.
Project Publishing: Publish the completed project on GitHub or any other version control platform, including:
